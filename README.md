## Introduction

The Connect 4 Game is a classic two-player board game where each player takes turns dropping colored balls (green and black) into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four balls of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent does. It's a fun and strategic game that requires critical thinking and planning.
